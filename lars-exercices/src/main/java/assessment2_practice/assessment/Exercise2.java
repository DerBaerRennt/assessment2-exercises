            Books are sold by a bookstore. A bookstore keeps track of the
            books and the available capacity of each book to ensure that only books in-stock
            are sold.

            Please check the implementation of the class Bookstore and use the given methods there
            before starting! Look at the JavaDoc comments and understand the structure of the two Maps
            which are used there:
            1. Map stock: contains pairs of ISBNs and amounts of the books (= number of pieces per book)
            2. Map bookDatabase: contains of pairs of ISBNs and book objects

            You do not have to check the validity of the books ISBNs in the following tasks!

        /*
            Exercise 2a: Head to the Bookstore class and implement the method addBook(Book b) there.
            This method shall add a book to the stock of the store as well as to the bookDatabase. It has
            to deal with both maps at the same time!
            The method shall do three things:
            1. If a book is not present in stock, it shall be added with the amount of "1"
            2. If a book is not present in the database, it shall be added.
            3. If a book is present (= ISBN already exists), its amount in stock shall be increased by 1
